# Weather analyzing system

A web platform that provides the analysis of weather and appropriate suggestions to the user depending upon the various factors especially trees density in the area using simple frameworks of HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySql.

# System Design
* There must be 149 trees for around 147 acres( around 278 trees per square kilometer)
* We have made the grading system based on ranges of around 100 trees
  - More than 280 trees is B grade
  - More than 380 trees is A grade.
* The grade is displayed on the screen depending upon the satisfaction of the above conditions and also how many more trees are required to be planted is displayed.
* We generalized the net oxygen production by category 1 and category 2 trees and multiplied it with total no. of trees to get the total amount of oxygen produced by the trees in a day as it is the key factor of our analysis.
* This way the user gets an better idea about the weather conditions of his locality.
* We provide a discussion forum for the interaction among the people regarding environmental cognizance.
* To develop  the curiosity as well as consciousness among the users, we have provided a survey quiz of 10 general questions.  
* We provide latest news and events happening around the globe about environmental issues and movements led by UN Council.
